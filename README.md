# In-Class Assignments - Excel Projects

This repository contains a collection of Excel files that were completed as part of in-class assignments. These files showcase my skills in various data management tasks, including:

- **Displaying Data**: Organizing and presenting data clearly in tables and charts.
- **Sorting Data**: Sorting data in ascending or descending order based on different criteria.
- **Deleting Data**: Removing unnecessary or duplicate data to maintain data integrity.
- **Joining Data**: Combining data from different sources or sheets to create comprehensive datasets.
- **Graphing Data**: Creating visual representations of data through various types of charts and graphs.

These examples demonstrate my ability to effectively manage and visualize data using Excel.
# Data Analysis and Visualization Projects

This repository contains two PowerPoint presentations that showcase my data analysis and visualization projects completed during my coursework.

## PowerPoint Presentations

### 1. **County Health Rankings & Roadmaps Analysis**

**Introduction:**
Our analysis is supported by data from the "Georgia | County Health Rankings & Roadmaps," provided by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. This comprehensive dataset, updated for 2023, is crucial for assessing health disparities across Georgia's counties. It includes 11 vital variables such as:

- County Name
- Number of Deaths
- County Value (mortality rate)
- Error Margin
- Demographic breakdowns by race (Asian, Black, Hispanic, White)
- Classification into Rural or Urban categories

The dataset serves as a foundational resource for addressing our research question and identifying potential areas for targeted health interventions. The number of deaths is measured per 100,000 children under 18 in each county.
