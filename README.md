# In-Class Assignments - Excel Projects

This repository contains a collection of Excel files that were completed as part of in-class assignments. These files showcase my skills in various data management tasks, including:

- **Displaying Data**: Organizing and presenting data clearly in tables and charts.
- **Sorting Data**: Sorting data in ascending or descending order based on different criteria.
- **Deleting Data**: Removing unnecessary or duplicate data to maintain data integrity.
- **Joining Data**: Combining data from different sources or sheets to create comprehensive datasets.
- **Graphing Data**: Creating visual representations of data through various types of charts and graphs.

These examples demonstrate my ability to effectively manage and visualize data using Excel.
